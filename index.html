            </h1>
            <p>
                Food provides opportunities for families to learn about responsibility and chores and about working and sharing time together. Clearly food plays a greater role than simply nourishing our bodies.

                CAMBA’s holistic supports are focused on ending generational cycles of poverty and homelessness. While families are living in shelter, staff provide parents with the skills they need to transition out of shelter including job training and placement opportunities for unemployed parents

                Education for a child
            </h1>
            <p>
                Without quality education, children face considerable barriers to employment and earning potential later in life. They are more likely to suffer adverse health outcomes and less likely to participate in decisions that affect them – threatening their ability to shape a better future for themselves and their societies.
